# Building Agents with the Anthropic API — Deep Dive

---

## 1. Concept Overview

The Anthropic API exposes a native tool use loop that is the canonical way to build agents on top of Claude. Unlike framework-wrapped approaches (LangChain, LangGraph), the native approach gives you direct control over the message flow, tool execution, and cost management — at the price of writing more orchestration code yourself.

The pattern: you send a message, Claude responds with either text or one-or-more `tool_use` content blocks, you execute the tools, append `tool_result` blocks to the conversation, and repeat until Claude stops requesting tools. This loop, combined with prompt caching, parallel tool execution, extended thinking, and subagent spawning, is the foundation under Claude Code, Anthropic's own Claude.ai agentic features, and many production agents.

This deep-dive treats "Claude agent SDK" not as a specific package but as the native pattern: the Anthropic Python and TypeScript SDKs combined with the API's tool use, prompt caching, and extended thinking features.

---

## 2. Intuition

**One-line analogy**: Building an agent on the Anthropic API is like writing a REPL — read a tool request from Claude, evaluate the tool, append the result, loop. The model is the read-eval; you provide the print-loop.

**Mental model**: The conversation is a list of messages. Each turn, you send the full conversation to Claude. Claude returns content blocks (text or tool_use). For each tool_use block, you execute the tool and append a matching tool_result block to the next user message. Repeat until Claude returns only text (no tool_use). This is the entire agent loop in ~30 lines of code.

**Why it matters**: Frameworks add abstractions that often hide failure modes — silent retries, hidden caching, opaque message manipulation. The native loop is explicit. You see exactly what's sent, exactly what comes back, exactly what you pay for. For production agents where reliability and cost matter, this transparency is worth the extra orchestration code.

**Key insight**: The most valuable feature of the native API for agents is parallel tool calls — Claude can return 3-5 tool_use blocks in one response, and you execute them all in parallel with `asyncio.gather()`. This single optimization cuts agent latency by 50-70% on multi-tool tasks compared to sequential frameworks.

---

## 3. Core Principles

- **Conversation is explicit**: Every message — user, assistant, tool results — is yours to manage. No hidden state.
- **Tools are typed**: Each tool has a name, description, and JSON Schema `input_schema`. Claude uses the description to decide when to call.
- **Parallel by default**: Claude returns multiple tool_use blocks per response. Always execute in parallel.
- **Cache the prefix**: System prompt + tool definitions + conversation prefix are eligible for prompt caching. Always cache.
- **Extended thinking is opt-in**: For complex reasoning, enable `thinking` mode. Otherwise standard mode is cheaper.
- **No automatic retries**: Errors propagate to your code. You decide retry strategy per tool.
- **Cost is observable**: Every response includes `usage` with input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens.

## 4. Types / Architectures / Strategies

### 4.1 Synchronous Tool Use Loop

The simplest pattern — useful for CLI agents and scripts where latency isn't critical.

### 4.2 Async Parallel Tool Execution

For production agents — execute multiple tool_use blocks concurrently with asyncio.

### 4.3 Streaming Tool Use

For UX-sensitive applications — stream tool decisions and arguments as they arrive. User sees the agent "typing" the tool call.

### 4.4 Extended Thinking + Tool Use

Available on Claude Opus 4.7 and Sonnet 4.6. Claude produces `thinking` content blocks before deciding to call tools. Enable for hard reasoning tasks; the thinking tokens are billed but typically improve tool selection quality significantly.

### 4.5 Subagent Pattern

Parent agent has a `dispatch_subagent(task, tools)` tool. When called, parent spawns a fresh Claude instance with a focused system prompt and a tool subset, runs the loop, and returns a structured result. Parent synthesizes results from multiple subagents.

### 4.6 Computer Use

The `computer` tool gives Claude `screenshot`, `mouse_move`, `left_click`, `type`, and `key` actions. Requires a VM or container with a display. The `computer_use_demo` reference implementation runs in Docker with Xvfb.

    U([User message]) --> S["Send messages\nto Claude"]
    S --> R["Claude response"]
    R -->|"text only"| Done([Return to user])
    R -->|"tool_use blocks"| E["Execute tools in parallel\n(asyncio.gather)"]
    E --> A["Append tool_results\nto messages"]
    A -->|"loop"| S

    class U,Done io
    class S,A req
    class R base
    class E frozen
```

The loop repeats — send, execute tool_use blocks, append tool_results — until Claude returns only text (stop_reason="end_turn"). Executing the tool_use blocks in parallel with `asyncio.gather()` is what cuts multi-tool latency 50-70%.

```
Parallel Tool Execution
========================

Sequential (slow):
  tool_a (1.5s) -> tool_b (2.1s) -> tool_c (0.8s) = 4.4s

Parallel (fast):
  tool_a -+
  tool_b -+--asyncio.gather()--> max(1.5, 2.1, 0.8) = 2.1s
  tool_c -+


Subagent Hierarchy
===================

  Parent Agent (Opus, full toolbox)
       |
       +-- dispatch_subagent("research X", [web_search, read_url])
       |        |
       |        v
       |   Subagent A (Sonnet, web tools only)
       |   Returns: {summary, citations, confidence}
       |
       +-- dispatch_subagent("analyze Y", [bash, read_file])
                |
                v
           Subagent B (Sonnet, file tools only)
           Returns: {analysis, errors}


Prompt Caching for Agents
==========================

  +----------------+----------------+----------------+
  |  System prompt |  Tool defs     |  Static prefix |  <-- CACHED
  |  (2000 toks)   |  (1500 toks)   |  (500 toks)    |      (90% cheaper on read)
  +----------------+----------------+----------------+
  |  Conversation history (variable, dynamic)        |  <-- NOT cached
  +--------------------------------------------------+
```

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    answer = asyncio.run(run_agent(
        "Compare the energy efficiency of GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.6 inference"
    ))
    print(answer)
```

### Extended Thinking + Tool Use (Opus 4.7)

```python
response = await client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=8192,
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 5000},  # Up to 5000 thinking tokens
    tools=TOOLS,
    messages=messages,
)

# Response content blocks now include `thinking` blocks before tool_use
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "thinking":
        print(f"[Thinking]: {block.thinking[:200]}...")
    elif block.type == "tool_use":
        print(f"[Tool call]: {block.name}({block.input})")
    elif block.type == "text":
        print(f"[Answer]: {block.text}")
```

### Cost Math for a 5-Step Agent (Sonnet 4.6)

| Step | Input toks | Output toks | Cache writes | Cache reads | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4000 (3500 cached new) | 800 | 3500 | 0 | 4000×$3 + 3500×$3.75 + 800×$15 = $0.038 |
| 2 | 5200 (3500 cache hit) | 750 | 0 | 3500 | 1700×$3 + 3500×$0.30 + 750×$15 = $0.027 |
| 3 | 6100 (3500 cache hit) | 600 | 0 | 3500 | 2600×$3 + 3500×$0.30 + 600×$15 = $0.028 |
| 4 | 6800 (3500 cache hit) | 500 | 0 | 3500 | 3300×$3 + 3500×$0.30 + 500×$15 = $0.028 |
| 5 | 7400 (3500 cache hit) | 1200 | 0 | 3500 | 3900×$3 + 3500×$0.30 + 1200×$15 = $0.041 |
| **Total** | | | | | **$0.162** |

Without caching: same task would cost ~$0.34 (2.1× more).

## 7. Real-World Examples

**Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI): native tool use with `bash`, file read/write, web fetch, and subagent dispatch. Uses prompt caching aggressively for the CLAUDE.md context injection.

**Cursor Composer**: Uses Anthropic API tool use for multi-file edits. Calls `edit_file` and `read_file` tools in parallel across multiple files.

**Replit Agent**: Anthropic API tool use loop running in a Replit container. Tools include shell, file editor, and `install_package`.

**Anthropic Research Multi-Agent System**: Parent Claude Opus agent dispatches Sonnet subagents in parallel for research tasks. Each subagent has a narrow tool subset (web only, or file only). Documented in Anthropic engineering blog as the pattern behind their research feature.

**Production customer support agent at scale**: Sonnet 4.6 with 5 tools (CRM lookup, KB search, refund issue, escalate, send_email). Handles 50K conversations/day. Average 3.2 tool calls per conversation, $0.018/conversation cost with caching.

## 8. Tradeoffs

| Dimension | Native Anthropic API | LangChain/LangGraph | OpenAI Agents SDK | CrewAI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Control over message flow | Full | Wrapped | Wrapped | Heavily abstracted |
| Parallel tool calls | Native, asyncio.gather | Via custom code | Native | Limited |
| Prompt caching | Native, explicit | Via callbacks | N/A (OpenAI) | Not supported |
| Extended thinking | Native | Via wrappers | N/A | Not supported |
| Subagent pattern | Hand-rolled | LangGraph subgraphs | handoff() primitive | Hierarchical processes |
| Observability | Manual logging | LangSmith built-in | OpenAI tracing | Custom |
| Learning curve | Low (REST API) | Medium-high | Low | Low |
| Lock-in | Anthropic only | Multi-provider | OpenAI only | Multi-provider |
| Best for | Production agents, cost-critical | Rapid prototyping, multi-provider | OpenAI-only stacks | Role-based simulations |

## 9. When to Use / When NOT to Use

**Use the native Anthropic API directly when:**
- Production agent where cost and reliability matter (full control over caching, retries)
- Latency-sensitive (parallel tool execution, streaming)
- You need extended thinking for complex reasoning
- You want to spawn subagents with custom logic
- Tool definitions are stable (not constantly experimented)

**Use a framework instead when:**
- Prototyping rapidly across multiple LLM providers
- You need built-in observability without setup (LangSmith)
- Complex stateful workflows with branching (LangGraph)
- Team unfamiliar with async Python

## 10. Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Sequential tool execution

```python
# BROKEN: Sequential — 4.4s total
for tool_use in tool_uses:
    result = await execute_tool(tool_use.name, tool_use.input)
    tool_results.append(result)
```

```python
# FIXED: Parallel — 2.1s total (max of individual tools)
tool_results = await asyncio.gather(
    *[execute_tool(tu.name, tu.input) for tu in tool_uses],
    return_exceptions=True,  # Don't fail all if one fails
)
```

### Pitfall 2: Missing tool_result for a tool_use

```python
# BROKEN: Some tool_use blocks have no matching tool_result
# Result: 400 error from API "tool_use_id not found"
for tu in tool_uses:
    try:
        result = await execute_tool(tu.name, tu.input)
        tool_results.append({"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": tu.id, "content": result})
    except SomeException:
        continue  # Silently skip — BREAKS the loop
```

```python
# FIXED: Always produce a tool_result for every tool_use, even on error
for tu in tool_uses:
    try:
        result = await execute_tool(tu.name, tu.input)
        tool_results.append({
            "type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": tu.id, "content": result
        })
    except Exception as e:
        tool_results.append({
            "type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": tu.id,
            "content": f"Error: {e}", "is_error": True,  # Let Claude see error and retry
        })
```

### Pitfall 3: Forgetting to cache the system prompt

```python
# BROKEN: System prompt sent fresh every iteration — pays $3/M for 2000 tokens × 10 calls
system = "You are a research assistant with these tools..." # 2000 tokens
response = await client.messages.create(model=..., system=system, ...)
# 10 iterations × 2000 tokens × $3/M = $0.06 just on system prompt
```

```python
# FIXED: Cache the system prompt
system = [{
    "type": "text",
    "text": "You are a research assistant...",
    "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"},
}]
# First call: 2000 tokens at $3.75/M (cache write) = $0.0075
# Calls 2-10: 2000 tokens at $0.30/M (cache read) = 9 × $0.0006 = $0.0054
# Total: $0.013 vs $0.06 — 78% savings
```

**War story**: A team running 100K agent conversations/day was billed $4200/month before they added prompt caching. Their system prompt was 3500 tokens describing 12 tools. After enabling cache_control on system+tools: bill dropped to $1100/month (74% reduction). The 5-minute cache TTL was sufficient because the agent processed conversations in bursts (each user had 5-20 messages within a 5-minute window).

## 12. Interview Questions with Answers

**What is the tool use loop in the Anthropic API?**
The tool use loop is the canonical agent pattern: send messages to Claude, receive a response with text and/or tool_use content blocks, execute each tool_use, append matching tool_result blocks to a user message, and repeat. The loop terminates when Claude returns only text (stop_reason="end_turn"). Each iteration is one API call.

**How do you execute multiple Claude tool calls in parallel?**
Use `asyncio.gather()` over the tool_use blocks: `results = await asyncio.gather(*[execute_tool(tu.name, tu.input) for tu in tool_uses])`. Always pass `return_exceptions=True` so one failing tool doesn't break the others — handle each result individually and convert exceptions to tool_result blocks with `is_error=True`.

**Why must every tool_use block have a corresponding tool_result?**
The Anthropic API enforces this — if you send a follow-up user message missing a tool_result for a previously returned tool_use_id, you get a 400 error. The model needs to see the outcome of every tool it called to update its reasoning. Always produce a tool_result, even on tool errors (use `is_error=True` so the model can self-correct).

**How does prompt caching work for agents and what does it save?**
Prompt caching marks a prefix of the prompt (system prompt + tool definitions + early conversation turns) as cacheable with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`. The cache is keyed by the exact prefix content and lives for 5 minutes. Cache writes cost 1.25× base input price; cache reads cost 0.1× base price. For agents with 2-3K token system prompts called 5-20 times in a session, caching saves 60-80% of input token cost.

**What is the difference between standard mode and extended thinking mode?**
Standard mode returns content as text or tool_use blocks immediately. Extended thinking mode (Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6+) adds a "thinking" phase before the response — Claude produces internal reasoning content blocks before deciding on tools or final answer. Thinking tokens are billed at output token price. Enable with `thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}`. Use for complex problems where reasoning quality matters more than latency.

**How do you implement subagent spawning with the native API?**
Define a `dispatch_subagent` tool with parameters {task, allowed_tools}. When the parent calls it, your code starts a fresh `run_agent()` call with a focused system prompt, the requested tool subset, and the task as user message. Run the subagent loop to completion. Return the subagent's final text as the tool_result. For parallel subagents, your parent's tool_use loop will gather them automatically via `asyncio.gather()`.

**What stop_reasons can the API return and what do they mean?**
`end_turn` (model finished naturally — extract final text), `tool_use` (model wants to call tools — execute and loop), `max_tokens` (hit the max_tokens limit — usually retry with larger limit), `stop_sequence` (matched a stop sequence — rare in agents), `pause_turn` (long-running operation paused — resume by sending an empty user turn). The loop logic branches on stop_reason.

**How do you handle a tool that returns 500KB of output?**
Truncate at the tool execution layer, not at the API layer. Cap at 50KB-100KB max, and add a marker like "[Truncated: 500000 chars total]" so Claude knows the data was cut off. If the tool is something like `read_file`, prefer adding a grep/extract parameter so Claude can request specific sections instead of dumping the whole file.

**What is the cost difference between Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus for the same agent task?**
Approximately 5× between adjacent tiers. Haiku 4.5: $0.80/M input, $4/M output. Sonnet 4.6: $3/M input, $15/M output (3.75× Haiku). Opus 4.7: $15/M input, $75/M output (5× Sonnet). For tool-heavy agents where reasoning quality matters, Sonnet is the typical sweet spot. Use Opus only for the hardest reasoning steps via cascading. Haiku for routing/classification.

**How do you stream tool use to the user?**
Use `client.messages.stream(...)` which yields events. Watch for `content_block_start` (with type=tool_use — start showing "Calling tool X..."), `content_block_delta` (with input_json_delta — progressively reveal the JSON arguments), and `content_block_stop` (tool args complete). Useful for UX where users want to see what the agent is doing before tools execute.

**How does the computer use tool work?**
The `computer` tool has actions: screenshot, mouse_move, left_click, right_click, double_click, type, key. Claude calls these to interact with a desktop environment. Your code must provide a real desktop (typically Docker container with Xvfb display) and execute the actions via pyautogui or similar. Each screenshot is returned as image content. Latency is high (5-10s per action) so use sparingly — prefer DOM-based browser tools when possible.

**When should you NOT use the native API and use a framework instead?**
When you need: (a) rapid prototyping across providers (LangChain abstracts model selection), (b) built-in observability without setup (LangSmith integrates with LangChain immediately), (c) complex stateful workflows with branching and persistence (LangGraph), (d) the team is unfamiliar with async Python. For production agents where cost, latency, and reliability dominate, native is usually better.

**How do you test an agent built on the native API?**
Mock the `client.messages.create` to return canned responses (mock the AsyncAnthropic class with `unittest.mock.AsyncMock`). Pre-record the sequence of tool_use blocks and final text for known scenarios. Assert that your tool execution code produces the expected tool_results. For end-to-end tests, use the real API with small inputs and assert on tool call counts and final answer patterns. Use `pytest-asyncio` for async test support.

**How do you handle rate limits from the API?**
The SDK auto-retries on 429 with exponential backoff (configurable via `max_retries`). For high-volume agents, implement your own queue with token bucket per minute (Anthropic rate limits are typically per-minute on tokens and per-minute on requests). Monitor 429 rates — if frequently rate-limited, request higher limits via Anthropic support or shift load with Batch API for non-real-time work (50% cost discount).

**What is the right way to handle conversation history that exceeds the context window?**
Claude has 200K token context. Track conversation token count after each response (`usage.input_tokens` tells you the full conversation size). When approaching 140K (70% of window), trigger compaction: summarize the early conversation turns with a separate LLM call and replace them with the summary. Keep the last N (typically 5-10) tool result pairs verbatim since they're often the most relevant.

**Why is parallel tool execution often a 2-3× speedup vs sequential?**
Tools spend most of their time waiting on I/O (HTTP requests, database queries, file reads). Sequential execution serializes the waits — 3 tools of 1.5s each = 4.5s total. Parallel execution overlaps the waits — 3 tools of 1.5s each = ~1.5s total. The model can request 3-5 parallel tools in one response, so the savings compound across the conversation. Without parallel execution, multi-tool agents feel sluggish even when the model decisions are fast.

## 13. Best Practices

1. Always use the async SDK (`AsyncAnthropic`) for agents — sync blocks the event loop and prevents parallel tool execution.
2. Always cache the system prompt + tool definitions with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` — typical 60-80% input cost reduction.
3. Always execute tool_use blocks in parallel with `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)`.
4. Always produce a tool_result for every tool_use, even on tool errors (with `is_error=True`).
5. Set a `max_iterations` cap in your agent loop (typical: 10-20) to prevent infinite loops.
6. Log `usage` fields after every API call — input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens — for cost attribution.
7. Truncate tool outputs at 50KB max before adding to tool_result content.
8. For complex reasoning, enable extended thinking on Opus/Sonnet — typical 10-20% quality improvement on hard tasks.
9. Pin model version in production (`claude-sonnet-4-6` not `claude-sonnet-latest`) — model updates can change behavior.
10. Write tool descriptions like API documentation — describe what it does, when to call it, what it returns, with example inputs.

## 14. Case Study

**Multi-Source Competitive Intelligence Agent**

**Context**: A B2B SaaS company needs a daily competitive intelligence report covering 20 competitors. Manual collection took an analyst 6 hours/day.

**Architecture**:

All 20 Sonnet subagents are dispatched in parallel via `asyncio.gather()`, each returning a structured result that the Opus parent synthesizes — total runtime ~90 seconds instead of a sequential 30+ minutes.

**Key implementation details**:
- System prompt (1800 tokens) + tools (1200 tokens) cached on every API call — 70% input cost savings.
- 20 subagents dispatched in parallel via `asyncio.gather()` — total runtime ~90 seconds despite 20 competitors.
- Each subagent has max_iterations=8 to bound cost; typical actual: 4-5 iterations.
- Parent extended thinking enabled (budget 3000 tokens) for final synthesis.

**Results**:
- Daily runtime: 90 seconds (was 6 hours manual)
- Daily cost: $1.20 (20 subagents × ~$0.04 each + parent synthesis $0.40)
- Quality: 92% of items flagged as "actionable" by the analyst on review (manual baseline: 88%)
- Caught a competitor pricing change in 11 minutes vs the analyst noticing it 2 days later in a competitor blog post

**Lessons learned**:
1. Without parallel subagent dispatch, runtime would have been 30+ minutes — the parallel pattern is what makes this practical.
2. Caching system prompts was non-negotiable — without it, daily cost would be $4.10.
3. Subagent tool subsetting (only web tools, no file/bash) gave clean failure modes — subagents couldn't accidentally affect host state.
4. Extended thinking on the parent dramatically improved synthesis quality — the parent caught patterns across competitors that single subagents missed.
