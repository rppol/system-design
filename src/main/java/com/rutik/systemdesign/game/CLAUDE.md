# CLAUDE.md — Game (browser app, template-exempt)

The `game/` directory is an application, not study content — see
[README.md](README.md) for architecture, features, and how to run it.

## Hard limits (user-set — do NOT change these, in any theme or redesign)

1. **The reader background is pitch black `#000000`, opaque, in EVERY theme.**
   Never translucent, never glass, never theme-tinted. The `--rd-bg` token in
   `style.css` must stay `#000000`, and no `[data-theme=...]` block may
   override the reader surface tokens.
2. **Reader prose text is pure white `#ffffff`** (`--rd-text`; changed from
   `#e6e6e6` on 2026-07-03 by owner request). Code blocks, ASCII diagrams, and
   Mermaid canvases keep the One Dark palette on their dark islands.

## Other invariants

- Vanilla JS + CSS, no build step, no frameworks, no external deps (the reader's
  mermaid CDN import is the only exception).
- **Pages-only (2026-07-03): `localStorage` `sd_progress` is the single source of
  truth and the single write path for all progress.** There is no server, no
  `/api`, no database, and no local scheduling stack. Every write goes through
  `saveSessionLocal()`; the reader fetches content at `../<path>`; **export/import
  from the Progress screen is the only backup path** between browsers.
- **The mirror-seam rule is DEAD** — there is no server to sync to, so there is no
  round-trip and no `POST`. A finished session writes straight to `localStorage`.
- **All persisted fields are additive** — never rename, repurpose, or drop an
  existing `sd_progress` field (old exports must still import). New state = a new
  field or a new `sd_*` key. `sd_last_mastery` (Home-render accuracy snapshot for
  the mastery-delta shine) is the only key E2 added.
- **The moments engine (`queueMoments`/`moment`) is the single celebration
  system** — level-ups, tier promotions, streak milestones, capsules, cleared
  backlog, goal all queue through it; do not add a parallel overlay/toast for a
  milestone. **`bonusXp` is the only XP side-channel** (everything above
  `correct × 10` — combos, boss, recall, double-down, seal — lands in it).
- **Deterministic randomness only** for anything that must survive a reload
  (gauntlet recipe, flip selection): seed on `todayISO()` via `cyrb53`/
  `mulberry32`/`seededShuffle`, never `Math.random()`.
- All app colors flow from tokens in `:root` / `[data-theme=...]` blocks in
  `style.css`; themes are set via `data-theme` on `<html>` (`?theme=` URL
  param previews without persisting). Any new color uses a token or `color-mix`,
  and must read on both midnight AND daylight.
- Date/time math flows through `todayISO()` / `nowHM()` (honoring the `?qa_date=` /
  `?qa_time=` QA seams); animations are `prefers-reduced-motion`-gated.
- Question ids are content-stable hashes (`module#md5(module|question)[:12]`);
  never revert to position-based ids — they orphan spaced-repetition state.
- `extract.py` emits, per question: `id`, `section`, `module`, `moduleName`,
  `sourceFile`, `difficulty`, `question`/`questionMd`, `answerFull`/`answerFullMd`,
  `correct`/`correctMd`, `distractors`/`distractorsMd`, `distractorIds`, `concepts`.
  **Re-run `python3 extract.py` after editing any module's Q&A**, then reload.
